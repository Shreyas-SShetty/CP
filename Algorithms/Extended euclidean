ax + by = c

bx1 + (a%b)*y1 = c
bx1 + (a - b(a/b))*y1 = c
ay1 + b(x1 - (a*y1)/b)) = c

therefore, x = y1 and y = x1 - (a/b) * y1



ll ext_euclidean(ll& x, ll& y, ll a, ll b, ll c) {
    //a > b

        y = 0;
        return a;

    ll x1, y1;
    ll gcd = f(x1, y1, b, a%b, c);
    x = y1;
    y = x1 - (a/b) * y1;
    return gcd;
