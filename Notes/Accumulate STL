Let A be an array of length 'n' containing some random elements.
We want to find the sum of first 'k' elements say,

Better way to do this is to use accumulate STL,
int sum_of_k = accumulate(A,A+k,0);
if long long int
accumulate(A, A+k, OLL)

Suppose we want to find the product of  the 'k' numbers,

int prod = accumulate(A, A+k, 1, [](auto &x,auto &y){ return x*y;});
